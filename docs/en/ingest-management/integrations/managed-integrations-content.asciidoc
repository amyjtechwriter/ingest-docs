Most integration content installed by {fleet} isnâ€™t editable. This content is tagged with a **Managed** badge in the {kib} UI. Managed content itself cannot be edited or deleted, however managed visualizations, dashboards, and saved searches can be cloned.

The cloned content is unlinked with the original reference configurations, so becomes independent from the original managed content. For example, with a cloned dashboard, the cloned panels become entirely self-contained copy without any dependencies on the original configuration. Clones can be customized and modified without accidentally affecting the original.

[NOTE]
====
The cloned managed content retains the managed badge, but is independent from the original.
